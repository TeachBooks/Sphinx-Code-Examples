    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "This extension provides three directives:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `codex`\n",
    "- `codex-start`\n",
    "- `codex-end`\n",
    "\n",
    "### `codex` directive\n",
    "\n",
    "```{warning}\n",
    "Although this directive is called `codex`, it does not imply that the code is executable. It is simply a directive to create the possibility to use one extension for both executable and non-executable (code) examples.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `codex` directive is used to create a code example with runnable code. It can be used as with the following minimal syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "````md\n",
    ":::{codex}\n",
    ":label: my-example\n",
    "\n",
    "Content of the directive.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "````\n",
    "\n",
    "This will be rendered as\n",
    "\n",
    ":::{codex}\n",
    ":label: my-example\n",
    "\n",
    "Content of the directive.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "### `codex-start` and `codex-end` directives\n",
    "\n",
    "The `codex-start` and `codex-end` directives are used to create a code example with runnable code. They can be used as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "````md\n",
    ":::{codex-start}\n",
    ":label: my-rendered-example\n",
    "\n",
    "Initial content of the directive.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "Other content of the directive, such as code blocks or text, can be added here.\n",

    "For runnable code, include the code as you are used to outside any other directive.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-cell} python\n",
    "print(\"This code should be runnable!\")\n",
    "```\n",
